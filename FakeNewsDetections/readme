The Passive-Aggressive algorithms are a family of Machine learning algorithms that are not very well known by beginners and even intermediate Machine Learning enthusiasts. However, they can be very useful and efficient for certain applications.

Passive-Aggressive algorithms are generally used for large-scale learning. It is one of the few ‘online-learning algorithms‘. In online machine learning algorithms, the input data comes in sequential order and the machine learning model is updated step-by-step, as opposed to batch learning, where the entire training dataset is used at once. This is very useful in situations where there is a huge amount of data and it is computationally infeasible to train the entire dataset because of the sheer size of the data. We can simply say that an online-learning algorithm will get a training example, update the classifier, and then throw away the example.

A very good example of this would be to detect fake news on a social media website like Twitter, where new data is being added every second. To dynamically read data from Twitter continuously, the data would be huge, and using an online-learning algorithm would be ideal.

Passive-Aggressive algorithms are somewhat similar to a Perceptron model, in the sense that they do not require a learning rate. However, they do include a regularization parameter.
